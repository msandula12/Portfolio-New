		Hello. This website was created to showcase the work I created while attending the Grand Circus JavaScript Bootcamp in February 2016. On this website you'll find a portfolio of my work and my résumé, as well as a little bit about myself.

			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

			My name is Michael Sandula. I'm 27 years old. I graduated from Oakland University in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. Since then, I've worked as a copy editor for a few places, most recently The Oakland Press. In February and March of 2016, I attended the Grand Circus JavaScript Bootcamp. When I'm not knee-deep in JavaScript, I can be found behind my drumset or buried in a book.
